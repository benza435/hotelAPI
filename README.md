# hotelAPI
Built while following the tutorial "Ultimate ASP.NET Core 5 Web API Development Guide" by Trevoir Williams.  

Currently there is a single endpoint that retreives a randomly generated "weather report".  
Hopefully some more interesting features are coming soon!  

Serilog config writes out events to a text file in the C:\ drive.  

We have a custom CORS policy to allow anything and everything.  Not great for security, but probably great for keeping it simple.  

Swagger is involved.  It seems to be self documenting the API.  Not sure if that is the correct terminology, but it's on the list.

Next up - Implementing data classes and entity framework.
